# tldraw take-home

This repo was created to showcase my response to the take-home challenge set by [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw)

We were tasked to implement the basics of the feature shown below using regular HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As a **stretch goal**, we were asked to think beyond the basic specification written in the ticket. What else did the demo show? What else might the stickers feature need before it was ready for people to use? We were challenged to pick one of the ideas we came up with and implement it in the app.

> Stickers are little shapes that you can stamp down on a drawing to give a quick thumbs up, share some love, vote on a topic, or bring some attention to part of the page. After choosing a sticker, a user can place a sticker by clicking anywhere on the page.

## Process

### Plan

I used GitHub issues to break down the instructions into a series of small, manageable tasks that could be completed in separate branches. At this stage, I also considered what I might add to the sticker feature to improve the user experience. I set up a ![GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/eliazzo/projects/4/views/1) to record and track my workflow.

### Build

My building process was roughly divided into 4 sections:

1. Initialise files and write template for sticker functionality using minimal HTML and CSS
2. Activate sticker functionality using vanilla JavaScript
3. Implement stretch goals
4. Review, refactor and test
